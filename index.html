		<h1>Mice</h1>

	<p>Mice can at times be harmful. Damaging and eating food causing structural damage and spreading diseases through their parasites and feces. During and after the treatment, we look for opening where mice can enter. So, they can be sealed to prevent new mice from enterning.</p>

	<p>Termites cause various damage. They primarily feed on wood but also damage paper, books, and even swimming pool liners and filtration systems. They can also injure living trees and shrubs. They are often seen around windows and doors. Termite-damaged wood is hollowed out along the grain. We prevent the termites from entering and infecting buildings.</p>
